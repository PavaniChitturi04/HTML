<p><b>Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature.

Drawbacks:Higher sea levels lead to flooding of lowlands. Islands and coastlines are engulfed by water leading to death and disease due to flooding.
Changes in ocean circulation and the resulting warmer temperatures disrupt the world's normal weather patterns, bringing about more extreme weather and an increased frequency of severe and catastrophic storms, such as hurricanes and typhoons.  </b><hr>
